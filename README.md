### Repository Structure

The repository is divided into folders for the years, which contain further folders with the days,
depending on the puzzle I have divided the solution for part one and two into multiple files. \
**(Input files are not included in the public repo)**

```tree
AdventOfCode
|-- year
|   |-- day_01
|   |   |-- puzzle_name.py
|   |   |-- puzzle_name_input
|   |
|   |-- day_02
|   |   |...
